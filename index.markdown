# Hi, I'm Daryl.

Iâ€™m the managing director of [Nightingale](https://nightingale.co.uk), a jewellery company based in York, United Kingdom, which is part of [The Embarking Group](https://embarking.co.uk). We create bespoke engagement rings and wedding rings using ethically mined stones and lab grown stones. We are pioneering the use of lab grown diamonds in jewellery in the UK.

I haven't posted much here but I post a little more frequently on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/daryl_shaw/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/daryl_shaw). I'm really enjoying running at the moment and you can follow my activities on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/15739817).

Want to get in touch? [Email me](mailto:daryl@darylshaw.co.uk).
