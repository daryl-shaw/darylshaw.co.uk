# Hi, I'm Daryl.

I currently run an independent jewellery business. We are pioneering the use of lab-grown diamonds in the UK to make ethical engagement rings.

I have a blog and the latest post is "[The Cinema](/blog/the-cinema/)". I'm also active on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/daryl_shaw/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/daryl_shaw). I enjoy running and you can follow my activities on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/15739817).

## What I can offer.

I help businesses manage their online presence with a particular focus on ecommerce. Looking for support with strategy or building and maintaining your website? [We should chat](mailto:hi@darylshaw.co.uk).
