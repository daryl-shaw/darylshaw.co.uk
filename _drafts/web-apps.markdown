Inspired by [Cushion's running costs page](https://cushionapp.com/running-costs), this post is a combination of web apps I use/respect plus what I look for when evaluation web apps.

When evaluating web apps there is a few things I look out for:

1. A clear separation between work and personal
2. Apps that integrate with each other

A clear separation between work and personal is something that is very important to me. I struggle to switch off from work.

## Trello (https://trello.com/)

Recently acquired by Atlassian (company behind JIRA, Bitbucket etc.). I used to use Trello for everything, from planning trips & holidays through to managing home moves and work projects. I scaled back how much I was using it but I'm starting to get back into it and I'm especially liking that you can now delete boards and the power-ups on boards. I've always used the Harvest Chrome extension (one of the main reasons for using Chrome) and that works very well with Trello.


A lot of web apps are geared towards teams (think Slack, G Suite). There is a selection of web apps below that have are more geared towards or have plans for individuals.

## Cushion (https://cushionapp.com/)

## Harvest (https://www.getharvest.com/)

## Pobox (https://www.pobox.com/)

If you are trying to cut down on the number of Google services you use or even go Google-free then this service can help with that (kind-of). For $20 / year you can hook up your personal domain.
