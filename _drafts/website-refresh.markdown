title: Website Refresh

I've gave my website a bit of a refresh. I've never been keen on it but it is one of those things that keeps getting pushed to the bottom of the pile but I decided to migrate it to use HTTPS everywhere the other day which was the catalyst for the refresh.

I wanted to make sure I had canonical links to the HTTPS version of each page. This isn't necessarily important for my site as it gets next to zero traffic but is a good tactic to employ whenever you are doing any type of migration where URLs are changing. The reason being that when you use a 301 redirect, having a canonical link that points to the version that you want Google to index

## Set Up

This post was typed up in Siteleaf. The site was originally on Siteleaf V1 but last Summer (around the time of my last post) I migrated it over to Siteleaf V2.

## Roadmap

* Fluid type

* Tags

* Pagination
