excerpt: Oatly have received some questionable funding.
---
Picked up some Oatly today and remembered seeing that they got some funding last week. This was led by private equity firm Blackstone. I&#39;m a fan of Oatly&#39;s brand and marketing but you have to question the ethics of this. Blackstone is contributing to the [destruction of the Amazon](https://theintercept.com/2019/08/27/amazon-rainforest-fire-blackstone/). They are also owned by a top donor to Trump.
