excerpt: Some thoughts on all-in-one tools.

In the [latest issue](https://www.densediscovery.com/issues/93) of Kai's newsletter, Dense Discovery, he opened up with this:

> When I recently logged into my Mailchimp account, I quickly got [frustrated](https://twitter.com/KaiBrach/status/1263225673251868672) trying to navigate my way around all the things I didn’t want to do. Even more off-putting than dealing with the usability challenges of feature bloat are the constant little hints that *I’m not doing enough*.

This sums up what I've thought about Mailchimp for a while now. Don't get me wrong, I like Mailchimp and think that it is a great tool for the customer it is targeting. I'm not that customer. 

The same way that Squarespace is an easy way to build a website and Shopify is an easy way to sell online. Mailchimp is an easy way to market your small business. Are there better ways? Absolutely. These all-in-one tools are like Swiss army knives. There is a lot to be said for tools that do one thing and do it well.
