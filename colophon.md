This is my personal website. It is always going to be a [work in progress](/blog/work-in-progress-part-two/).

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/darylshaw/darylshaw.co.uk). If you have any problems using the site, find an error or bug, you can [file an issue](https://github.com/darylshaw/darylshaw.co.uk/issues).

This site is running on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll provides built-in support for [Sass.](https://sass-lang.com/) It ships with its own Sass converter meaning there is nothing to install to process Sass.

I _finally_ finished moving hosting to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) from GitHub Pages in 2020\. After starting this back in 2018\. Netlify has nice features built-in. I switched to Netlify's free one-click SSL to prevent running [into](https://community.netlify.com/t/common-issue-why-not-proxy-to-netlify/8869) [issues](https://community.netlify.com/t/common-issue-why-isn-t-my-ssl-certificate-provisioning-automatically-with-cloudflare-netlify-are-there-other-problems-with-using-cloudflare-in-front-of-netlify/138). They have over [1 millions developers](https://million-devs.netlify.com/) using the platform and there is a good team behind it.

Hosting with Netlify solves my issues around using unsupported GitHub Pages gems. For example, tagging was a pain. For the time being I've removed tags from posts so you need a direct link to reach the tag pages. I need to find the time to put in place a better solution and start tagging posts.

Not every website needs a CMS. This website is a prime example of one that doesn't. Saying that, I've added [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to the site to replace [Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/?via=daryl). My reason for having a CMS is that it _might_ make it easier for me to publish to the site. I love Siteleaf. But to use it I would have needed to upgrade to the team plan. Which is overkill for a site that doesn't need a CMS. [Indiekit](https://getindiekit.com/) allows me to publish content to my website using [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) and the [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) apps.

There are a couple of sans-serif fonts on show. [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for the body. [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) for the headings.
