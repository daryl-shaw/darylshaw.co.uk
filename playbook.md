## Setting up a new Mac

This is for my own benefit when setting up a new Mac. But you may pick up tips along the way.

I find it refreshing starting up a new device and having that clean OS to work from. Before it gets cluttered with apps, packages, and libraries. I enjoy the set up process rather than seeing it as a chore.

My first step when setting up a new device used to be to delete the built-in/pre-installed apps that I didn't use. I had a list of apps to download and trash when setting up a new Mac.

More recently I've tried a new approach:

1. Adopt built-in Apple apps and OS features over third-party standalone apps where possible. Apple tend to roll out features and settings to copy popular apps which makes this easier. For example I check Screen Time instead of using RescueTime. The level of data RescueTime tracked unsettled me.
2. Use the browser before reaching for an app. Use app if there is a clear use case and benefit over the browser. There is a lot you can do in the browser. I don't need added notifications and distractions on top of my procrastination.
3. Download apps as I need them rather than spending time upfront getting them set up. I may find I don't use the app and didn't need it after all. See previous point about the browser.

As much as I am trying to follow the above. There are a couple of holdout apps for me:

* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - more powerful than Spotlight. The hotkey is in my muscle memory. I've been using the app for over 7 years! I don't have the Powerpack upgrade with the current version. Powerpack brings a lot more features and workflows. For example, I could integrate Alfred and [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) to look up WP-CLI commands
* [Flux](https://justgetflux.com/) helps me get a better night's sleep. Apple has copied this with their Night Shift setting. I prefer Flux

Apart from that I install:

* [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) - again Apple are giving you more control over system apps these days. Bartender helps to tidy up the rest
* [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) to replace default Calendar app. Feature bloat with latest version but preferred to default Apple Calendar app
* Spotify (for now). I will miss connect and the made for you playlists if I switched away
* [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) for emojis ðŸš€

Mina has a solid [macOS setup script](https://github.com/minamarkham/formation).

I'm missing a VPN. Used ProtonVPN in the past. ExpressVPN or NordVPN look like good options.

Retired apps:

* [BeardedSpice](https://beardedspice.github.io/) - Mac Media Keys for the Masses. RIP iTunes
* [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) was handy. Used the window snapping feature a lot over the years with my (sold) Thunderbolt Display. But didn't have a need for the other features. I've managed to avoid the Touch Bar. Can tile windows in macOS if I need to
* [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/) is a useful app I've used over the years for organisation. I can use the System Information app to empty the bin after 30 days for me and optimise storage. This is a built-in app and suits my needs. Avoid CleanMyMac and similar
* [Tyke](https://tyke.app/) - I'm a heavy Apple Notes user. Downloaded [Tot](https://tot.rocks/) to try which Tyke inspired
* Various productivity apps ([Aware](https://awaremac.com/), [Time Out](https://www.dejal.com/timeout/)). [Setapp](https://setapp.com/) looks interesting. Time Out is in the suite of apps along with others I use or have used (Bartender, BetterTouchTool, Dash, Numi, Sizzy). All for $9.99/month

Pre-installed apps to trash:

* GarageBand - use the System Information app to clear out song library content

**Dock Preferences**

* Turn hiding on
* Don't show recent applications in Dock

This covers top-level utility/misc apps and preferences. Deeper, more specific breakdown of what I use on the way.

## About the playbook

This is a work in progress. I have docs spread out over Google Drive, Dropbox Paper, Notion, Basecamp. Guides to how I work. I'll be migrating them to their new home, here.
