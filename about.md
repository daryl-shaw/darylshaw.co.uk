Hey, I'm Daryl. I'm a London-based technical marketer and web developer.

I've been working on the web since ~2013. Helping businesses manage their online presence. The majority of that time with a small agency working with ambitious businesses.

I did spend two-and-a-half years running a jewellery company in York. We were one of the first in the UK to sell diamonds grown in a lab.

Away from work you'll find me ~~supporting~~ suffering Newcastle. Out on a long-run. Or hitting the trails. I get out to run with [GoodGym](https://www.goodgym.org/) as much as I can.
